## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Our team, Scaladoop, is going to implement a movie recommendation system that can help you to choose movie to watch!

To practice not only machine learning with Scala, but also the use of distributed systems, we will run our model distributed on 2-3 different machines using Hadoop Cluster and Spark framework for Scala to speed up computations.

This report covers all the steps that we performed and that lead us to a successful achievement of the goal.
